## Introduction

This repository provides a streamlined API layer built on top of Salesforce, designed using the [RAW platform](https://raw-labs.com/). The API simplifies access to Salesforce data by offering well-defined endpoints for major Salesforce objects, such as accounts, contacts, leads, opportunities, and custom entities. By leveraging the RAW platform, this solution efficiently handles data retrieval and filtering without the need for complex setups or additional infrastructure.

The goal of this API is to make Salesforce data easily accessible for various applications and services, focusing on simplicity, flexibility, and scalability. Each endpoint is designed to return relevant data with support for filtering through query parameters, allowing users to query Salesforce data in a straightforward, RESTful manner.

### Endpoints

Please refer to the [API documentation](openapi.md) and [OpenAPI spec yaml](openapi.yaml) for a detailed list of endpoints and their descriptions.


## Basic Structure of SQL Files

Each SQL file contains a query that retrieves data from Salesforce. The queries are written in standard SQL and are designed for flexibility, supporting dynamic filtering and pagination.


## Types of Queries

1. **Basic & Hierarchical Queries**: These queries retrieve data from a single table or a set of joined tables with potential parent-child relationships. Dynamic filtering and pagination are supported.
2. **Summary Queries**: These queries aggregate data using functions like `SUM`, `COUNT`, `AVG`, etc.


#### Basic Query Example
Here is an example of a basic query from <m>accounts.sql</m>:

```sql

## Filters

This section explains the different types of filters used in the SQL queries:

### Basic Equality Filters

These filters check if a column's value is equal to a specified parameter or `NULL` if no filter is applied.

**Example:**

```sql
AND (is_deleted = :account_is_deleted OR :account_is_deleted IS NULL)
```

### Substring Search

These filters search for substrings in columns. If no filter is applied, the parameter is `NULL`.

**Example:**

```sql
AND (name ILIKE CONCAT('%', :account_name, '%') OR :account_name IS NULL)
```

### Equality Search with Any Value from a Comma-Separated List

These filters allow matching any value from a comma-separated list, or no filter if the parameter is `NULL`.

**Example:**

```sql
AND (industry ILIKE ANY (string_to_array(:account_industry, ',')) OR :account_industry IS NULL)
```

### Date Comparison

These filters compare a column’s date value with a specified date range, or allow null values if no filter is applied.

**Example:**

```sql
AND (created_date >= :account_created_date_range_start OR :account_created_date_range_start IS NULL)
```

## Pagination

The queries support pagination through the use of `LIMIT` and `OFFSET`. The `page` parameter specifies the current page number, while the `page_size` parameter controls the number of records per page. The default value for `page_size` is 25.

**Example:**

```sql
LIMIT COALESCE(:page_size, 25)
OFFSET (COALESCE(:page, 1) - 1) * COALESCE(:page_size, 25);
```
